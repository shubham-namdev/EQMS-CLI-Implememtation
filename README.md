# EQMS Lite CLI

EQMS Lite CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) clone of the EQMS Lite app. It provides similar functionalities to the app, allowing users to manage product information and inquiries conveniently through the terminal.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Add, view, and delete product information such as name, price, etc.
- **Inquiry Handling**: Record inquiries about products.
- **Data Persistence**: Stores data collected in separate text files (`products.txt` and `enquiry.txt`) for easy retrieval and management.

## Installation

All available options will be displayed in the terminal. Follow the prompts to perform various operations such as adding/viewing/deleting products and inquiries.

- `products.txt`: Contains product information.
